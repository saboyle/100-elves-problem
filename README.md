# 100 Elves problem

In a hotel with 100 rooms there are a number of elves:

* Type 1 - closes any open doors and opens any closed doors
* Type 2 - goes to every other door and closes it if it's open, opens it if it's closed
* Type 3 - goes to every 3rd door and closes it if it's open, opens it if it's closed
* Type 4 - goes to every 4th door and closes it if it's open, opens it if it's closed

If there are 100 elves who go through the hotel (ordered Type 1-4, 1-4 etc) and all doors 
are initially closed, how many doors are open when all the elves have walked through the 
hotel.
